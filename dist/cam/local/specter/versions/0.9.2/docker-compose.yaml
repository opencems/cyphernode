# <%= APP_UPSTREAM_HOST %>: Hostname for the upstream into cyphernodes reverse proxy to expose the app to the world
# <%= APP_ID %> use this to avoid conflicts in hostname in case you have multiple services in your app
# if you need those values inside your app, you can pass them in the environment
# container names will be ignored
# Prefix all container names you use with the <%= APP_ID %> to prevent unwanted namespace collision
# between apps. It's very likely if you use a database like redis or mongo that you will name this
# container 'mongo' or 'redis' like every other app developer, so there will be container name
# collisions. Consider using '<%= APP_ID %>_redis' or '<%= APP_ID %>_mongo' instead.
# container names will be checked and if they don't contain the unique part, the app won't be
# able to be installed

# NOTE
# ${ RUNTIME_VAR }  <-  evaluated at start
# <%= STATIC_VAR %> <-  evaluated at install
